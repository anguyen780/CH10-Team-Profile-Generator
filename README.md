# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

This weeks challenge we were in charge of creating a team page based off of users input using the inquirer package. Using the concepts of OOP and TDD I was able to grab the user inputs and style it on the page using bootstrap. Then I was able to run tests to make sure my code was working using jest module.
